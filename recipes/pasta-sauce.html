    <h3>Using fresh mushrooms makes this sauce meaty and filling. </h3>
    <p>The use of your favorite jarred sauce makes it easy. The finished sauce tastes homemade. Use a large pot or Dutch oven. Serve sauce topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese if you like.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>½ pound fresh baby portobello mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>½ pound fresh button mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dry red wine, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano</li>
        <li>1 (23 ounce) jar pasta sauce (such as Prego®)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add portobello mushrooms, button mushrooms, and onion. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms release their juices and onion is soft and translucent, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in wine to deglaze the pot, scraping up any bits stuck to the bottom.</li>
        <li>Pour in diced tomatoes and cook, stirring, until liquid has slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add pasta sauce, garlic, Italian seasoning, sugar, salt, and pepper; stir to combine. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce temperature to low and simmer, uncovered, until flavors have blended and desired thickness has been reached, about 15 minutes. Stir sauce occasionally.</li>
    </ol>
