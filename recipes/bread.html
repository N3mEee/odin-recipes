    <p>It's braided and topped with poppy seeds for a beautiful presentation.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>½ cup honey</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 eggs, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>8 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon poppy seeds (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour warm water into a large bowl; sprinkle yeast over water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat in honey, oil, 2 eggs, and salt. Add flour, 1 cup at a time, beating after each addition until dough has pulled together; turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic. Place dough in a large, lightly-oiled bowl and turn to coat. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 1/2 hours.Beat in honey, oil, 2 eggs, and salt.

        <li>Punch down dough and turn onto a lightly floured surface. Divide in half and knead each half for 5 minutes or so, adding flour as needed to keep it from getting sticky. Divide each half into thirds and roll into a long snake about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Pinch the ends of the three snakes together firmly and braid from middle. Either leave as a braid or form into a round braided loaf by bringing ends together, curving the braid into a circle, and pinching ends together. Grease two baking trays and place the finished braid or round on each. Cover with a towel and let rise for about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>reheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the remaining egg and brush a generous amount over each braid; sprinkle with poppy seeds.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 40 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for at least one hour before slicing.</li>
